**Mission**: provide more than 100 user-friendly demos in python. 

Users can run them locally. Moreover, developers can dubug them locally to identify bugs; however, using notebooks is impossible.


**Principles**: 

1) Do not put definitions of functions, which should be put in .py of the folders except tutorials_notebook and tutorials_python.
2) The codes will be copied to the corresponding notebook in tutorials_notebook.
