**Mission**: provide more than 100 user-friendly demos in notebooks. 

**Principles**: 

1) Do not put definitions of functions in notebooks, which should be put in .py of the folders except tutorials_notebook and tutorials_python.
2) The contents in notebooks are separated into two parts. The first part is installing commands. The second part is copied directly from the corresponding .py in tutorials_python.
